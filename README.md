# Ruby: List Ops

Implement basic list operations

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

The tests use the Minitest testing framework. To install it run the command:

    gem install minitest

Run the tests with the `ruby` command:

    ruby list_ops_test.rb

## Resources

If you have never used Minitest, check out [Intro to TDD][tdd] tutorial from Jumpstart Lab.
